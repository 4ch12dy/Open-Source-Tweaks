### Cr4shed
Download Cr4shed from Packix as it can give more information for me. [Link](https://repo.packix.com/package/com.muirey03.cr4shed/)

### CrashReporter
You may have to install CrashReporter from CokePoke's [repo](https://cokepokes.github.io) for it to work.

### Debug Deb
The debug version just allows Cr4shed and CrashReporter to tell me the cause of the crash.

### Why is it so Difficult to Fix This?
Because this crash has only occured to me once, about 4 months ago, and had yet to happen again. That's why I need the crash information from your devices.

### How to Help
Make sure you have both Cr4shed and CrashReporter installed along with the debug version of Speculum. Then when the crash occurs both Cr4shed and Crashreporter should both have generated crash reports that you can send to me via email LacertosusThemes@gmail.com.
